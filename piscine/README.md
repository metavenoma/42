# 42 Piscine Progress

This repository contains the code I created during the 26-day intensive selection process for 42 school. The piscine covered a wide range of topics in programming, including C, shell scripting, and more.
## Overview

The piscine at 42 is designed to be an intense and immersive introduction to programming. Over the course of 26 days, students are challenged to learn new concepts and implement them in a series of increasingly difficult projects.

The projects cover a wide range of topics, including:

   * C programming fundamentals
   * Memory management and pointers
   * Data structures and algorithms
   * Network programming
   * Web development
   * Shell scripting
   * And more

Throughout the piscine, students are encouraged to collaborate with each other, share knowledge, and learn from their mistakes.
Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders for each list I made off of the piscine program. Each folder contains the code I wrote for the corresponding day's projects and exercises. I did not do the whole curriculum, since I did not come from programming background (I actually don't know of anyone who actually did all the lists).

## Conclusion

The 42 piscine was a challenging and rewarding experience, and I learned a lot about programming in a short amount of time. I'm proud of the code I wrote during the piscine and look forward to continuing to learn and grow as a programmer.
