# fract_ol_mini

In this project, I did the fract'ol project from 42 all over again, in a (pretty messy) simpler way, so it could fit in a single source file with only 5 functions.
I always thought this was the simplest out of the 3 graphical projects, and always wondered if it were possible to make it work (within the norm, without leaks and doing everything the subject asks) in only one file, and today I had free time, so I did it!
