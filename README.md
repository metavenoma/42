in june/2022 I applied to 42 school (in São Paulo) and went through their selecting process - which is a 4-week-nonstop basecamp in C, that happens in a 24/7 campus with no teachers, and without being able to use C standard libraries. the alumni can create their own schedule and engage as much as they can/want. it was an ASTONISHING experience for me and I discover a whole new bundle of capacities, interests and desires, and also found a methodology that really works for me. so now I'm a full-time student in 42 São Paulo, and my progress within the curriculum - as well as the repositoire for each can be seen bellow;

my goal is to write a little bit about every project in their respective README.md file, and hopefully be able to communicate a little bit of my mental proccess developing each code;

hopefully this will serve as a kind of journal and also as a portifolio, since I'm now building my skills, interests and research.
