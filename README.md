# 42 Piscine Progress

This repository contains the code I created during the 26-day intensive selection process for 42 school. The piscine covered a wide range of topics in programming, including C, shell scripting, and more.
## Overview

The piscine at 42 is designed to be an intense and immersive introduction to programming. Over the course of 26 days, students are challenged to learn new concepts and implement them in a series of increasingly difficult projects.

The projects cover a wide range of topics, including:

   * C programming fundamentals
   * Memory management and pointers
   * Data structures and algorithms
   * Network programming
   * Web development
   * Shell scripting
   * And more

Throughout the piscine, students are encouraged to collaborate with each other, share knowledge, and learn from their mistakes.
Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders for each day of the piscine. Each folder contains the code I wrote for the corresponding day's projects and exercises.

Some of the projects in this repository include:

    rush00: A group project to create a two-player game
    bsq: A program that finds the largest square of open space in a map of obstacles
    ft_printf: A reimplementation of the C printf function
    minitalk: A client-server program for sending messages between processes
    pipex: A program for executing shell commands with input and output piped between them
    libft: A library of useful C functions

## Conclusion

The 42 piscine was a challenging and rewarding experience, and I learned a lot about programming in a short amount of time. I'm proud of the code I wrote during the piscine and look forward to continuing to learn and grow as a programmer.
