# Piscine Reloaded

The piscine_reloaded repository contains the code I wrote for the Piscine Reloaded project, which is part of the curriculum at 42 school.
Overview

The Piscine Reloaded project is a review of the C programming concepts covered in the 42 piscine. It is designed to reinforce the fundamental concepts of programming and provide an opportunity to practice them in a series of smaller projects.

The project covers a wide range of topics, including:

    * Basic C programming concepts
    * Memory allocation and deallocation
    * Pointers and arrays
    * Command-line arguments
    * Basic file I/O
    * And more

Throughout the project, students are encouraged to work independently and seek help from their peers and instructors when needed.
## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders for each section of the project. Each folder contains the code I wrote for the corresponding section's exercises.

Some of the exercises in this repository include

    * ex00: 
    * ex02: 
    * ex04: 
    * ex08:

## Conclusion

The Piscine Reloaded project was a valuable review of the C programming concepts covered in the 42 piscine. It provided an opportunity to reinforce the fundamentals of programming and practice them in a series of smaller projects. I'm proud of the code I wrote for this project and look forward to continuing to learn and grow as a programmer.
