# Libft

libft is a library of C functions that I created for personal use in my own projects within the 42 school curriculum.
## Overview

The libft library is a collection of useful C functions that I wrote to simplify common programming tasks. The functions cover a wide range of topics, including:

    Character and string manipulation
    Memory allocation and deallocation
    Data structures, such as linked lists and binary trees
    Mathematical operations
    And more

The functions are designed to be efficient and easy to use, with clear documentation and error handling.
## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders for each category of functions. Each folder contains the source code for the corresponding functions, as well as a header file with function prototypes and macros.

Some of the categories of functions in this repository include:

    libft: The core library functions, such as memset, memcpy, and strlen
    ft_printf: A reimplementation of the C printf function
    get_next_line: A function for reading input from a file descriptor line by line
    ft_lst: Functions for working with linked lists, such as ft_lstnew and ft_lstadd_back
    ft_btree: Functions for working with binary trees, such as ft_btree_create_node and ft_btree_level_order

## Conclusion

The libft library has been a valuable tool for me in my programming projects within the 42 school curriculum. It has saved me time and effort by providing efficient and reliable implementations of common programming tasks. I'm proud of the code I wrote for this library and look forward to continuing to use and improve it in my future projects.
