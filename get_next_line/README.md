# Get Next Line

The get_next_line function is a C function that reads a file descriptor one line at a time. It is a useful function for handling input from files, pipes, and other input streams.
## Usage

To use the get_next_line function in your C program, simply include the get_next_line.h header file and call the function with the file descriptor of the input stream you want to read from. The function will return the next line of text from the input stream, or NULL if there are no more lines to read.

Here is an example usage of the get_next_line function:


```C
#include "get_next_line.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    int fd;
    char *line;

    fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)))
    {
        printf("%s\n", line);
        free(line);
    }
    return (0);
}
```

## Concepts Implemented

The get_next_line function implements several important concepts in C programming, including file I/O, memory allocation and deallocation, and pointer manipulation.
### File I/O

The get_next_line function reads input from a file descriptor using the read system call. It handles buffering and input parsing to return complete lines of text, even if they are split across multiple read calls.
### Memory Allocation and Deallocation

The get_next_line function dynamically allocates memory to store the lines of text it reads from the input stream. It is the responsibility of the calling function to free this memory when it is no longer needed.
### Pointer Manipulation

The get_next_line function uses pointers extensively to manage memory and manipulate strings. It is a good example of how to use pointers effectively in a C program.
## Focus of the Program

The focus of the get_next_line program is to provide a simple and efficient way to read input from a file descriptor one line at a time. It is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing C programs, while also implementing best practices for memory management and file I/O.
## Acknowledgements

This implementation of the get_next_line function was created by metavenoma as a project for the 42 school.
